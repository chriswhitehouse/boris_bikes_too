### User Story 8
```
As a system maintainer,
So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
I want to be able to specify a larger capacity when necessary.
```

### User Story 9
```
As a member of the public,
So that I reduce the chance of getting a broken bike in future,
I'd like to report a bike as broken when I return it.
```

|---|---|
|Person |   |
|DockingStation| dock  |
```
DockingStation <-- bike.report_broken --> Bike
```

### User Story 12
```
As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like vans to take broken bikes from docking stations and deliver them to garages to be fixed.
```

|Van| take_broken, deliver_broken_bike  |
|Garage| accept_broken  |
|Bike|  |
|DockingStation|  |
```
Van <-- take_broken(Bike)
Van <-- deliver_broken_bike --> Bike
Garage <-- accept_broken(Bike)
```

### User Story 13
```
As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,

Van <-- collect_working(Bike)
Van <-- distribute_working_bike --> Bike
```

## Code Example
The following is the 'Bike Container' module that forms the basis of the DockingStation, Van, and Garage classes.
```ruby
module BikeContainer
  DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 20

  attr_reader :capacity

  def initialize(capacity = DEFAULT_CAPACITY)
    @capacity = capacity
    @bikes = []
  end

  def add(bike)
    raise "#{self.class.name} full" if full?
    bikes << bike
  end

  def remove_bike
    raise "#{self.class.name} empty" if empty?
    bikes.pop
  end

  def empty?
    bikes.empty?
  end

  def full?
    bikes.count >= capacity
  end

  private

  attr_reader :bikes
end
```
